<strong>Scaling Up From Regional Case Studies to a Global Harmful Algal
Bloom Observing System</strong>. Frontiers in Marine Science. 6, <a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2019.00250" class="external-link uri">https://doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2019.00250</a>

<p>Harmful algal blooms (HABs) produce local impacts in nearly all
freshwater and marine systems. They are a global problem that require
integrated and coordinated scientific understanding leading to regional
responses and solutions. Given that these natural phenomena will never
be completely eliminated, improved scientific understanding of HAB
dynamics coupled with monitoring and ocean observations facilitates new
prediction and prevention strategies. Regional efforts are underway
worldwide to create state-of-the-art HAB monitoring and forecasting
tools, vulnerability assessments, and observing networks. In the United
States, these include Alaska, Pacific Northwest, California, Gulf of
Mexico, Gulf of Maine, Great Lakes, and the U.S. Caribbean islands. This
paper examines several regional programs in the United States, European
Union, and Asia and concludes that there is no one-size-fits-all
approach. At the same time, successful programs require strong
coordination with stakeholders and institutional sustainability to
maintain and reinforce them with new automating technologies, wherever
possible, to ensure integration of modelling efforts with multiple
regional to national programs. Recommendations for scaling up to a
global observing system for HABs can be summarized as follows: 1)
advance and improve cost-effective and sustainable HAB forecast systems
that address the HAB-risk warning requirements of key end-users at
global and regional levels; 2) design programs that leverage and expand
regional HAB observing systems to evaluate emerging technologies for
Essential Ocean Variables (EOVs) and Essential Biodiversity Variables
(EBVs) in order to support interregional technology comparisons and
regional networks of observing capabilities; 3) fill the essential need
for sustained, preferably automated, near real-time information from
nearshore and offshore sites situated in HAB transport pathways to
provide improved, advanced HAB warnings; 4) merge ecological knowledge
and models with existing Earth System Modelling Frameworks to enhance
end-to-end capabilities in forecasting and scenario-building; 5) provide
seasonal to decadal forecasts to allow governments to plan, adapt to a
changing marine environment, and ensure coastal industries are supported
and sustained in the years ahead; and 6) support implementation of the
recent calls for action by the United Nations Decade 2010 Sustainable
Development Goals (SDGs) to develop indicators that are relevant to an
effective and global HAB early warning system.</p>

<p>Toxic algal events are an annual burden on aquaculture and coastal
ecosystems of California. The threat of domoic acid (DA) toxicity to
human and wildlife health is the dominant harmful algal bloom (HAB)
concern for the region, leading to a strong focus on prediction and
mitigation of these blooms and their toxic effects. This paper describes
the initial development of the California Harmful Algae Risk Mapping
(C-HARM) system that predicts the spatial likelihood of blooms and
dangerous levels of DA using a unique blend of numerical models,
ecological forecast models of the target group, Pseudo-nitzschia, and
satellite ocean color imagery. Data interpolating empirical orthogonal
functions (DINEOF) are applied to ocean color imagery to fill in missing
data and then used in a multivariate mode with other modeled variables
to forecast biogeochemical parameters. Daily predictions (nowcast and
forecast maps) are run routinely at the Central and Northern California
Ocean Observing System (CeNCOOS) and posted on its public website. Skill
assessment of model output for the nowcast data is restricted to
nearshore pixels that overlap with routine pier monitoring of HABs in
California from 2014 to 2015. Model lead times are best correlated with
DA measured with solid phase adsorption toxin tracking (SPATT) and
marine mammal strandings from DA toxicosis, suggesting long-term
benefits of the HAB predictions to decision-making. Over the next three
years, the C-HARM application system will be incorporated into the NOAA
operational HAB forecasting system and HAB Bulletin.</p>

through cross-national cooperation: A case study from the Northeast
Pacific</strong>. Frontiers in Marine Science. 6, <a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2019.00093" class="external-link uri">https://doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2019.00093</a>

<p>The ocean knows no political borders. Ocean processes, like
summertime wind-driven upwelling, stretch thousands of kilometers along
the Northeast Pacific (NEP) coast. This upwelling drives marine
ecosystem productivity and is modulated by weather systems and seasonal
to interdecadal ocean-atmosphere variability. Major ocean currents in
the NEP transport water properties such as heat, fresh water, nutrients,
dissolved oxygen, pCO 2 , and pH close to the shore. The eastward North
Pacific Current bifurcates offshore in the NEP, delivering open-ocean
signals south into the California Current and north into the Gulf of
Alaska. There is a large and growing number of NEP ocean observing
elements operated by government agencies, Native American Tribes, First
Nations groups, not-for-profit organizations, and private entities.
Observing elements include moored and mobile platforms, shipboard repeat
cruises, as well as land-based and estuarine stations. A wide range of
multidisciplinary ocean sensors are deployed to track, for example,
upwelling, downwelling, ocean productivity, harmful algal blooms, ocean
acidification and hypoxia, seismic activity and tsunami wave
propagation. Data delivery to shore and observatory controls are done
through satellite and cell phone communication, and via seafloor cables.
Remote sensing from satellites and land-based coastal radar provide
broader spatial coverage, while numerical circulation and biogeochemical
modeling complement ocean observing efforts. Models span from the deep
ocean into the inland Salish Sea and estuaries. NEP ocean observing
systems are used to understand regional processes and, together with
numerical models, provide ocean forecasts. By sharing data, experiences
and lessons learned, the regional ocean observatory is better than the
sum of its parts.</p>

With Stock-Specific Ecosystem Information</strong>. Frontiers in Marine
Science. 8, <a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2021.602072" class="external-link uri">https://doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2021.602072</a>

<p>Although frequently suggested as a goal for ecosystem-based fisheries
management, incorporating ecosystem information into fisheries stock
assessments has proven challenging. The uncertainty of input data,
coupled with the structural uncertainty of complex multi-species models,
currently makes the use of absolute values from such models contentious
for short-term single-species fisheries management advice. Here, we
propose a different approach where the standard assessment methodologies
can be enhanced using ecosystem model derived information. Using a case
study of the Irish Sea, we illustrate how stock-specific ecosystem
indicators can be used to set an ecosystem-based fishing mortality
reference point (FECO) within the “Pretty Good Yield” ranges for fishing
mortality which form the present precautionary approach adopted in
Europe by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea
(ICES). We propose that this new target, FECO, can be used to scale
fishing mortality down when the ecosystem conditions for the stock are
poor and up when conditions are good. This approach provides a
streamlined quantitative way of incorporating ecosystem information into
catch advice and provides an opportunity to operationalize ecosystem
models and empirical indicators, while retaining the integrity of
current assessment models and the FMSY-based advice process.</p>

Atlantic Menhaden Established Using an Ecosystem Model of Intermediate
Complexity</strong>. Frontiers in Marine Science. 7, <a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2020.606417" class="external-link uri">https://doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2020.606417</a>

<p>Atlantic menhaden (Brevoortia tyrannus) are an important forage fish
for many predators, and they also support the largest commercial fishery
by weight on the U.S. East Coast. Menhaden management has been working
toward ecological reference points (ERPs) that account for menhaden’s
role in the ecosystem. The goal of this work was to develop menhaden
ERPs using ecosystem models. An existing Ecopath with Ecosim model of
the Northwest Atlantic Continental Shelf (NWACS) was reduced in
complexity from 61 to 17 species/functional groups. The new NWACS model
of intermediate complexity for ecosystems (NWACS-MICE) serves to link
the dynamics of menhaden with key managed predators. Striped bass
(Morone saxatilis) were determined to be most sensitive to menhaden
harvest and therefore served as an indicator of ecosystem impacts. ERPs
were based on the tradeoff relationship between the equilibrium biomass
of striped bass and menhaden fishing mortality (F). The ERPs were
defined as the menhaden F rates that maintain striped bass at their
biomass target and threshold when striped bass are fished at their
Ftarget, and all other modeled species were fished at status quo levels.
These correspond to an ERP Ftarget of 0.19 and an ERP Fthreshold of
0.57, which are lower than the single species reference points by
30–40%, but higher than current (2017) menhaden F. The ERPs were then
fed back into the age-structured stock assessment model projections to
provide information on total allowable catch. The ERPs developed in this
study were adopted by the Atlantic menhaden Management Board, marking a
shift toward ecosystem-based fishery management for this economically
and ecologically important species.</p>

<p>Two foundational questions about sustainability are “How are
ecosystems and the services they provide going to change in the future?”
and “How do human decisions affect these trajectories?” Answering these
questions requires an ability to forecast ecological processes.
Unfortunately, most ecological forecasts focus on centennial-scale
climate responses, therefore neither meeting the needs of near-term
(daily to decadal) environmental decision-making nor allowing comparison
of specific, quantitative predictions to new observational data, one of
the strongest tests of scientific theory. Near-term forecasts provide
the opportunity to iteratively cycle between performing analyses and
updating predictions in light of new evidence. This iterative process of
gaining feedback, building experience, and correcting models and methods
is critical for improving forecasts. Iterative, near-term forecasting
will accelerate ecological research, make it more relevant to society,
and inform sustainable decision-making under high uncertainty and
adaptive management. Here, we identify the immediate scientific and
societal needs, opportunities, and challenges for iterative near-term
ecological forecasting. Over the past decade, data volume, variety, and
accessibility have greatly increased, but challenges remain in
interoperability, latency, and uncertainty quantification. Similarly,
ecologists have made considerable advances in applying computational,
informatic, and statistical methods, but opportunities exist for
improving forecast-specific theory, methods, and cyberinfrastructure.
Effective forecasting will also require changes in scientific training,
culture, and institutions. The need to start forecasting is now; the
time for making ecology more predictive is here, and learning by doing
is the fastest route to drive the science forward.</p>

2021. <strong>Balancing Model Complexity, Data Requirements, and
Management Objectives in Developing Ecological Reference Points for
Atlantic Menhaden</strong>. Frontiers in Marine Science. 8, <a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2021.608059" class="external-link uri">https://doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2021.608059</a>

<p>Atlantic menhaden is an important forage fish and the target of the
largest fishery along the US East Coast by volume. Since 1999, managers
at the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission, stakeholders, and
scientists have been interested in developing ecological reference
points (ERPs) that account for menhaden’s role as a forage species. To
accomplish this, we developed a suite of modeling approaches that
incorporated predation on menhaden and changes in productivity over time
and allowed for evaluation of trade-offs between menhaden harvest and
ecosystem management objectives. These approaches ranged in complexity,
from models with minimal data requirements and few assumptions to
approaches with extensive data needs and detailed assumptions. This
included a surplus production model with a time-varying intrinsic growth
rate, a Steele-Henderson surplus production model, a multispecies
statistical catch-at-age model, an Ecopath with Ecosim (EwE) model with
a limited predator and prey field, and a full EwE model. We evaluated
how each model could address managers’ objectives and compared outputs
across the approaches, highlighting their strengths, weaknesses, and
management utility. All models produced estimates of age-1 + biomass and
exploitation rate that were similar in trend and magnitude to the
single-species statistical catch-at-age model, especially in recent
years. While the less complex models were relativity easy to implement
and update, they lacked key elements needed to manage multiple species
simultaneously. More complex models required a wider array of data and
were more difficult to update within the current management time-frames,
but produced a more useful framework for managers. Ultimately, an EwE
model of intermediate complexity coupled with the existing
single-species assessment model was recommended for use in
management.</p>

for the North-East Atlantic Shellfish Aquaculture Industry</strong>.
Frontiers in Marine Science. 8, <a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2021.666583" class="external-link uri">https://doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2021.666583</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Across the European Atlantic Arc (Scotland, Ireland, England, France,
Spain, and Portugal) the shellfish aquaculture industry is dominated by
the production of mussels, followed by oysters and clams. A range of
spatially and temporally variable harmful algal bloom species (HABs)
impact the industry through their production of biotoxins that
accumulate and concentrate in shellfish flesh, which negatively impact
the health of consumers through consumption. Regulatory monitoring of
harmful cells in the water column and toxin concentrations within
shellfish flesh are currently the main means of warning of elevated
toxin events in bivalves, with harvesting being suspended when toxicity
is elevated above EU regulatory limits. However, while such an approach
is generally successful in safeguarding human health, it does not
provide the early warning that is needed to support business planning
and harvesting by the aquaculture industry. To address this issue, a
proliferation of web portals have been developed to make monitoring data
widely accessible. These systems are now transitioning from “nowcasts”
to operational Early Warning Systems (EWS) to better mitigate against
HAB-generated harmful effects. To achieve this, EWS are incorporating a
range of environmental data parameters and developing varied forecasting
approaches. For example, EWS are increasingly utilizing satellite data
and the results of oceanographic modeling to identify and predict the
behavior of HABs. Modeling demonstrates that some HABs can be advected
significant distances before impacting aquaculture sites. Traffic light
indices are being developed to provide users with an easily interpreted
assessment of HAB and biotoxin risk, and expert interpretation of these
multiple data streams is being used to assess risk into the future.
Proof-of-concept EWS are being developed to combine model information
with in situ data, in some cases using machine learning-based
approaches. This article: (1) reviews HAB and biotoxin issues relevant
to shellfish aquaculture in the European Atlantic Arc (Scotland,
Ireland, England, France, Spain, and Portugal; (2) evaluates the current
status of HAB events and EWS in the region; and (3) evaluates the
potential of further improving these EWS though multi-disciplinary
approaches combining heterogeneous sources of information.</p>

<p>The Mesoamerican Agroenvironmental Program (MAP-Norway) is a
multi-dimensional rural development program implemented in Central
America since 2009, working with smallholder families, producer
organizations, governmental organizations, and regional governance
platforms. To monitor, assess, and evaluate the effects of the program
on its beneficiaries, MAP-Norway uses a series of indicators that allow
project managers and donors to adapt and follow-up on the interventions.
Because gender is a cross-cutting theme in the program, gender
indicators are used at all levels: families, producer organizations, and
governmental organizations and governance platforms. In this document,
we use the experience of MAP-Norway to critically assess these
indicators, considering their potential usability in the monitoring and
evaluation of climate-smart agriculture (CSA) initiatives. Furthermore,
we propose a series of other indicators that capture various dimensions
of gender relations. These indicators can be used to assess the effect
of CSA practices, services, and technologies on equity in
decision-making, women’s empowerment (including economic empowerment),
intra-household food security, and equity in ownership over productive
resources, among others, thus providing evidence that can help better
design and target CSA interventions.</p>

frequency, and concomitant with that is interest in incorporating these
processes in fish stock assessments and forecasting models. Previous
research suggests that including environmental drivers of fish
recruitment in forecasting is of limited value, concluding that
forecasting improvements are minimal while potential spurious
relationships were sufficient to advise against inclusion. This review
evaluates progress in implementing environmental factors in
stock-recruitment projections and Management Strategy Evaluations
(MSEs), from the year 2000 through 2017, by reviewing studies that
incorporate environmental processes into recruitment forecasting,
full-cycle MSEs, or simulations investigating harvest control rules. The
only successes identified were for species with a short pre-recruit
survival window (e.g., opportunistic life-history strategy), where the
abbreviated life-span made it easier to identify one or a limited set of
key drivers that directly impact dynamics. Autoregressive methods
appeared to perform as well, if not better, for species with a longer
pre-recruit survival window (e.g., seasonal, inter-annual) during which
the environment could potentially exert influence. This review suggests
that the inclusion of environmental drivers into assessments and
forecasting is most likely to be successful for species with short
pre-recruit survival windows (e.g., squid, sardine) and for those that
have bottlenecks in their life history during which the environment can
exert a well-defined pressure (e.g., anadromous fishes, those reliant on
nursery areas). The effects of environment may be more complicated and
variable for species with a longer pre-recruit survival window, reducing
the ability to quantify environment-recruitment relationships. Species
with more complex early life histories and longer pre-recruit survival
windows would benefit from future research that focuses on relevant
species-specific spatio-temporal scales to improve mechanistic
understanding of abiotic-biotic interactions.</p>

<p>The effects of increasing fishing pressure in combination with
temperature increases in the Nordic and Barents Seas have been evaluated
using an end-to-end model for the area forced by a downscaled RCP 4.5
climate scenario. The scenarios that have been applied have used four
different fractions of fisheries mortality at maximum sustainable yield
(Fmsy); 0.6, 0.8, 1.0 and 1.1 × Fmsy. As it is highly likely that more
ecosystem components will be harvested in the future, the four scenarios
have been repeated with fishing on a larger number of ecosystem
components, including harvesting of lower trophic levels
(mesozooplankton and mesopelagic fish). The zooplankton biomass had an
increasing trend, regardless of the increase in fishing pressure on
their predators. However, when introducing harvest on the lower trophic
levels, this increase was no longer evident. When harvesting more
components, the negative response in biomass of pelagic and demersal
fish to increasing harvest became more prominent, indicating an
increasing vulnerability in the ecosystem structure to stressors.
Although harvest on lower trophic level led to an immense increase in
the total catch, it also resulted in a decrease in the total catches of
pelagic and demersal fish, despite more species being harvested in these
guilds.</p>

<p>The production of marine protein from fishing and aquaculture is
influenced by environmental conditions. Ocean temperature, for example,
can change the growth rate of cultured animals, or the distribution of
wild stocks. In turn these impacts may require changes in fishing or
farming practices. In addition to short-term environmental fluctuations,
long-term climate-related trends are also resulting in new conditions,
necessitating adjustment in fishing, farming and management approaches.
Longer-term climate forecasts, however, are seen as less relevant by
many in the seafood sector owing to more immediate concerns. Seasonal
forecasts provide insight into upcoming environmental conditions, and
thus allow improved decision making. Forecasts based on dynamic ocean
models are now possible and offer improved performance relative to
statistical forecasts, particularly given baseline shifts in the
environment as a result of climate change. Seasonal forecasting is being
used in marine farming and fishing operations in Australia, including
wild tuna and farmed salmon and prawns, to reduce uncertainty and manage
business risks. Forecast variables include water temperature, rainfall
and air temperature, and are considered useful up to approximately
4 months into the future, depending on the region and season of
interest. Species-specific habitat forecasts can also be made by
combining these environment forecasts with biological habitat preference
data. Seasonal forecasts are useful when a range of options are
available for implementation in response to the forecasts. The use of
seasonal forecasts in supporting effective marine management may also
represent a useful stepping stone to improved decision making and
industry resilience at longer timescales.</p>

<p>Forecasts of marine environmental and ecosystem conditions are now
possible at a range of time scales, from nowcasts to forecasts over
seasonal and longer time frames. Delivery of these products offers
resource managers and users relevant insight into ecosystem patterns and
future conditions to support decisions these stakeholders face
associated with a range of objectives. The pace of progress in forecast
development is so rapid that the scientific community may not be
considering fully the impacts on stakeholders and their incentives.
Delivery of information, particularly about future conditions and the
uncertainties associated with it, involves a range of judgements, or
{“}ethical{”} considerations, including treatment of forecast failure,
inequity in stakeholder response options, and winners and losers in
commercial markets. Here, we explore these often unanticipated
considerations via a set of case studies spanning commercial fishing,
recreational fishing, aquaculture, and conservation applications. We
suggest that consideration of ethical issues by scientists and their
research partners is needed to maintain scientific integrity and
fairness to end users. Based on these case studies and our experience,
we suggest a set of ten principles that might be considered by
developers and users of ecological forecasts to avoid these ethical
pitfalls. Overall, an interdisciplinary approach, and co-production with
end users will provide insurance against many unanticipated
consequences.</p>

<p>The Alaska Climate Integrated Modeling (ACLIM) project represents a
comprehensive, multi-year, interdisciplinary effort to characterize and
project climate-driven changes to the eastern Bering Sea (EBS)
ecosystem, from physics to fishing communities. Results from the ACLIM
project are being used to understand how different regional fisheries
management approaches can help promote adaptation to climate-driven
changes to sustain fish and shellfish populations and to inform managers
and fishery dependent communities of the risks associated with different
future climate scenarios. The project relies on iterative communications
and outreaches with managers and fishery-dependent communities that have
informed the selection of fishing scenarios. This iterative approach
ensures that the research team focuses on policy relevant scenarios that
explore realistic adaptation options for managers and communities.
Within each iterative cycle, the interdisciplinary research team
continues to improve: methods for downscaling climate models,
climate-enhanced biological models, socio-economic modeling, and
management strategy evaluation (MSE) within a common analytical
framework. The evolving nature of the ACLIM framework ensures improved
understanding of system responses and feedbacks are considered within
the projections and that the fishing scenarios continue to reflect the
management objectives of the regional fisheries management bodies. The
multi-model approach used for projection of biological responses,
facilitates the quantification of the relative contributions of climate
forcing scenario, fishing scenario, parameter, and structural
uncertainty with and between models. Ensemble means and variance within
and between models inform risk assessments under different future
scenarios. The first phase of projections of climate conditions to the
end of the 21st century is complete, including projections of catch for
core species under baseline (status quo) fishing conditions and two
alternative fishing scenarios are discussed. The ACLIM modeling
framework serves as a guide for multidisciplinary integrated climate
impact and adaptation decision making in other large marine
ecosystems.</p>

<strong>Combining Ecosystem and Single-Species Modeling to Provide
Ecosystem-Based Fisheries Management Advice Within Current Management
Systems</strong>. Frontiers in Marine Science. 7, <a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2020.607831" class="external-link uri">https://doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2020.607831</a>

<p>Although many countries have formally committed to Ecosystem-Based
Fisheries Management (EBFM), actual progress toward these goals has been
slow. This paper presents two independent case studies that have
combined strategic advice from ecosystem modeling with the tactical
advice of single-species assessment models to provide practical
ecosystem-based management advice. With this approach, stock status,
reference points, and initial target F are computed from a
single-species model, then an ecosystem model rescales the target F
according to ecosystem indicators without crossing pre-calculated
single-species precautionary limits. Finally, the single-species model
computes the quota advice from the rescaled target F, termed here Feco.
Such a methodology incorporates both the detailed population
reconstructions of the single-species model and the broader ecosystem
perspective from ecosystem-based modeling, and fits into existing
management schemes. The advocated method has arisen from independent
work on EBFM in two international fisheries management systems: (1)
Atlantic menhaden in the United States and (2) the multi species
fisheries of the Irish Sea, in the Celtic Seas ecoregion. In the
Atlantic menhaden example, the objective was to develop ecological
reference points (ERPs) that account for the effect of menhaden harvest
on predator populations and the tradeoffs associated with forage fish
management. In the Irish Sea, the objective was to account for ecosystem
variability when setting quotas for the individual target species. These
two exercises were aimed at different management needs, but both arrived
at a process of adjusting the target F used within the current
single-species management. Although the approach has limitations, it
represents a practical step toward EBFM, which can be adapted to a range
of ecosystem objectives and applied within current management
systems.</p>

<p>Phytoplankton blooms are complex ecological events that emerge from
the dynamics of an entire ecosystem. Increasing efforts to forecast
blooms are hampered by inconsistent definitions of what constitutes a
bloom event, from both conceptual (mechanistic) and empirical
(quantitative) perspectives. By clarifying definitions of blooms using
temporal system dynamics, we propose to target modeling and forecasting
methods to appropriate settings, and generate testable ecological
hypotheses into the underlying processes fueling bloom development.
Here, we present a general bloom definition that highlights both growth
and loss processes, and identify quantitative metrics of time-series
structure associated with several subclasses of blooms. We hypothesize
ecological processes that are consistent with these time-series
structures, and that suggest promising approaches for forecasting
different types of blooms.</p>

<p>Marine ecosystem forecasting is an area of active research and rapid
development. Promise has been shown for skillful prediction of physical,
biogeochemical, and ecological variables on a range of timescales,
suggesting potential for forecasts to aid in the management of living
marine resources and coastal communities. However, the mechanisms
underlying forecast skill in marine ecosystems are often poorly
understood, and many forecasts, especially for biological variables,
rely on empirical statistical relationships developed from historical
observations. Here, we review statistical and dynamical marine ecosystem
forecasting methods and highlight examples of their application along
U.S. coastlines for seasonal-to-interannual (1–24 month) prediction of
properties ranging from coastal sea level to marine top predator
distributions. We then describe known mechanisms governing marine
ecosystem predictability and how they have been used in forecasts to
date. These mechanisms include physical atmospheric and oceanic
processes, biogeochemical and ecological responses to physical forcing,
and intrinsic characteristics of species themselves. In reviewing the
state of the knowledge on forecasting techniques and mechanisms
underlying marine ecosystem predictability, we aim to facilitate
forecast development and uptake by (i) identifying methods and processes
that can be exploited for development of skillful regional forecasts,
(ii) informing priorities for forecast development and verification, and
(iii) improving understanding of conditional forecast skill (i.e., a
priori knowledge of whether a forecast is likely to be skillful). While
we focus primarily on coastal marine ecosystems surrounding North
America (and the U.S. in particular), we detail forecast methods,
physical and biological mechanisms, and priority developments that are
globally relevant.</p>

<p>Climate impacts disproportionately affect people that are most
vulnerable and least able to adapt. The extent to which these equity
impacts extend to fishing communities in the developed world is a
question that has received surprisingly little attention. Here we
explore the distributional impacts of a climate shock in one of the
largest and most valuable fisheries on the West Coast of the United
States. Specifically, we examine whether a series of two harmful algal
blooms (HABs), occurring during the 2014–2016 Northeast Pacific Marine
Heatwave, differentially affected small and large vessels in the
commercial California Dungeness crab fishery. The HAB events were
managed with localized fishery closures in response to elevated levels
of the HAB toxin, domoic acid, in crab tissue. We find evidence that
large vessels had a greater ability to mitigate losses from the HAB
events. Thus, the proportion of total revenue going to small-vessel
operators and the proportion of small-vessel participation in the
fishery fell in response to the HAB events in several California fishing
ports. Our results, therefore, offer empirical evidence that climate
impacts on fishing communities are not uniform and offer insights into
potential alternative adaptation strategies for different ocean user
groups.</p>

<p>Management strategy evaluation (MSE) provides a simulation framework
to test the performance of living marine resource management. MSE has
now been adopted broadly for use in single-species fishery management,
often using a relatively simple “operating model” that projects
population dynamics of one species forward in time. However, many
challenges in ecosystem-based management involve tradeoffs between
multiple species and interactions of multiple stressors. Here we use
complex operating models, multi-species ecosystem models of the
California Current and Nordic and Barents Seas, to test threshold
harvest control rules that explicitly address the linkage between
predators and prey, and between the forage needs of predators and
fisheries. Specifically, within Atlantis ecosystem models we focus on
how forage (zooplankton) availability affects the performance of harvest
rules for target fish, and how these harvest rules for fish can account
for environmentally-driven fluctuations in zooplankton. Our
investigation led to three main results. First, consistent with studies
based on single-species operating models, we found that compared to
constant F = FMSY policies, threshold rules led to higher target stock
biomass for Pacific hake (Merluccius productus) in the California
Current and mackerel (Scomber scombrus) in the Nordic and Barents Seas.
Performance in terms of catch of these species varied depending partly
on the biomass and recovery trajectory for the simulated stock.
Secondly, the multi-species operating models and the harvest control
rules that linked fishing mortality rates to prey biomass (zooplankton)
led to increased catch variability; this stemmed directly from the
harvest rule that frequently adjusted Pacific hake or mackerel fishing
rates in response to zooplankton, which are quite variable in these two
ecosystems. Thirdly, tests suggested that threshold rules that increased
fishing when productivity (zooplankton) declined had the potential for
strong ecosystem effects on other species. These effects were most
apparent in the Nordic and Barents Seas simulations. The tests of
harvest control rules here do not include uncertainty in monitoring of
fish and zooplankton, nor do they include uncertainty in stock
assessment and implementation; these would be required for full MSE.
Additionally, we intentionally chose target fish with strong mechanistic
links to particular zooplankton groups, with the simplifying assumption
that zooplankton biomass followed a forced time series. Further
developing and testing of ecosystem-level considerations can be achieved
with end-to-end ecosystem models, such as the Atlantis models applied
here, which have the added benefit of tracking the follow-on effects of
the harvest control rule on the broader ecosystem.</p>

<p>Despite the significant advances in making monthly or seasonal
forecasts of weather, ocean hypoxia, harmful algal blooms and marine
pathogens, few such forecasting efforts have extended to the ecology of
upper trophic level marine species. Here, we test our ability to use
short-term (up to 9 months) predictions of ocean conditions to create a
novel forecast of the spatial distribution of Pacific sardine, Sardinops
sagax. Predictions of ocean conditions are derived using the output from
the Climate Forecast System (CFS) model downscaled through the Regional
Ocean Modeling System (ROMS). Using generalized additive models (GAMs),
we estimated significant relationships between sardine presence in a
test year (2009) and salinity and temperature. The model, fitted to 2009
data, had a moderate skill [area under the curve (AUC) = 0.67] in
predicting 2009 sardine distributions, 5-8 months in advance.
Preliminary tests indicate that the model also had the skill to predict
sardine presence in August 2013 (AUC = 0.85) and August 2014 (AUC =
0.96), 4-5 months in advance. The approach could be used to provide
fishery managers with an early warning of distributional shifts of this
species, which migrates from the U.S.-Mexico border to as far north as
British Columbia, Canada, in summers with warm water and other favorable
ocean conditions. We expect seasonal and monthly forecasts of ocean
conditions to be broadly useful for predicting spatial distributions of
other pelagic and midwater species.</p>

<p>A shift towards ecosystem-based management in recent decades has led
to new analytical tools such as end-to-end marine ecosystem models.
End-to-end models are complex and typically simulate full ecosystems
from oceanography to foodwebs and fisheries, operate on a spatial
framework, and link to physical oceanographic models. Most end-to-end
approaches allow multiple ways to implement human behaviours involving
fishery catch, fleet movement, or other impacts such as nutrient loading
or climate change effects. Though end-to-end ecosystem models were
designed specifically for marine management, their novelty makes them
unfamiliar to most decision makers. Before such models can be applied
within the context of marine management decisions, additional levels of
vetting will be required, and a dialogue with decision makers must be
initiated. Here we summarize a review of an Atlantis end-to-end model,
which involved a multi-day, expert review panel with local and
international experts, convened to challenge models and data used in the
management context. We propose nine credibility and quality control
standards for end-to-end models intended to inform management, and
suggest two best practice guidelines for any end-to-end modelling
application. We offer our perspectives (as recent test subjects or
{“}Guinea pigs{”}) on how a review could be motivated and structured and
on the evaluation criteria that should be used, in the most specific
terms possible.</p>

<p>Climate change and ocean acidification are anticipated to alter
marine ecosystems, with consequences for the provision of marine
resources and ecosystem services to human societies. However,
considerable uncertainties about future ecological changes and ensuing
socio-economic impacts impede the identification of societal adaptation
strategies. In a case study from the Barents Sea and Northern Norwegian
Sea region, we integrated stakeholder perceptions of ecological changes
and their significance for societies with the current state of
scientific knowledge, to investigate the marine-human system under
climate change and identify societal adaptation options. Stakeholders
were engaged through personal interviews, two local workshops, and a web
based survey, identifying the most relevant ecosystem services
potentially impacted and developing an integrated system dynamics model
which links climate change scenarios to the response of relevant
species. Stakeholder perceptions of temperature-dependent multiannual
fluctuations of fish stocks, interactions among fish, marine mammal, and
seabird populations, and ecological processes such as primary production
are represented in the model. The model was used for a discourse-based
stakeholder evaluation of potential ecosystem changes under ocean
warming and acidification scenarios, identifying shifts in ecosystem
service provision and discussing associated societal adaptation options.
The results pointed to differences in adaptive capacity among user
groups. Small-scale fishers and tourism businesses are potentially more
affected by changing spatial distribution and local declines in marine
species than industrial fisheries. Changes in biodiversity, especially
extinctions of polar species, and ecosystem functioning were a concern
from an environmental conservation viewpoint. When considering potential
additional impacts of ocean acidification, changes observed in the model
projections were more uniformly valued as negative, and associated with
an increased potential for conflicts among user groups. The
stakeholder-informed ecosystem modeling approach has succeeded in
driving a discussion and interchange among stakeholder groups and with
scientists, integrating knowledge about climate change impacts in the
social-ecological system and identifying important factors that shape
societal responses. The approach can thus serve to improve governance of
marine systems by incorporating knowledge about system dynamics and
about societal uses and values.</p>

<p>The FAIRWAY project reviewed approaches for protecting drinking water
from nitrate and pesticide pollution. A comprehensive assessment of
decision support tools (DSTs) used by farmers, advisors, water managers
and policy makers across the European Union as an aid to meeting CAP
objectives and targets was undertaken, encompassing paper-based
guidelines, farm-level and catchment level software, and complex
research models. More than 150 DSTs were identified, with 36 ranked for
further investigation based on how widely they were used and/or their
potential relevance to the FAIRWAY case studies. Of those, most were
farm management tools promoting smart nutrient/pesticide use, with only
three explicitly considering the impact of mitigation methods on water
quality. Following demonstration and evaluation, 12 DSTs were selected
for practical testing at nine diverse case study sites, based on their
pertinence to local challenges and scales of interest. Barriers to DST
exchange between member states were identified and information was
collected about user requirements and attitudes. Key obstacles to
exchange include differences in legislation, advisory frameworks,
country-specific data and calibration requirements, geo-climate and
issues around language. Notably, DSTs from different countries using the
same input data sometimes delivered very different results. Whilst many
countries have developed DSTs to address similar problems, all case
study participants were able to draw inspiration from elsewhere. The
support and advice provided by skilled advisors was highly valued,
empowering end users to most effectively use DST outputs.</p>

<p>Ecosystem-based management (EBM) of the ocean considers all impacts
on and uses of marine and coastal systems. In recent years, there has
been a heightened interest in EBM tools that allow testing of
alternative management options and help identify tradeoffs among human
uses. End-to-end ecosystem modeling frameworks that consider a wide
range of management options are a means to provide integrated solutions
to the complex ocean management problems encountered in EBM. Here, we
leverage the global advances in ecosystem modeling to explore common
opportunities and challenges for ecosystem-based management, including
changes in ocean acidification, spatial management, and fishing pressure
across eight Atlantis (atlantis.cmar.csiro.au) end-to-end ecosystem
models. These models represent marine ecosystems from the tropics to the
arctic, varying in size, ecology, and management regimes, using a
three-dimensional, spatially-explicit structure parametrized for each
system. Results suggest stronger impacts from ocean acidification and
marine protected areas than from altering fishing pressure, both in
terms of guild-level (i.e., aggregations of similar species or groups)
biomass and in terms of indicators of ecological and fishery structure.
Effects of ocean acidification were typically negative (reducing
biomass), while marine protected areas led to both {“}winners{”} and
{“}losers{”} at the level of particular species (or functional groups).
Changing fishing pressure (doubling or halving) had smaller effects on
the species guilds or ecosystem indicators than either ocean
acidification or marine protected areas. Compensatory effects within
guilds led to weaker average effects at the guild level than the species
or group level. The impacts and tradeoffs implied by these future
scenarios are highly relevant as ocean governance shifts focus from
single-sector objectives (e.g., sustainable levels of individual fished
stocks) to taking into account competing industrial sectors’ objectives
(e.g., simultaneous spatial management of energy, shipping, and fishing)
while at the same time grappling with compounded impacts of global
climate change (e.g., ocean acidification and warming).</p>

<p>For forest sustainability and vulnerability assessment, the landscape
scale is considered to be more and more relevant as the stand level
approaches its known limitations. This review, which describes the main
forest landscape simulation tools used in the 20 European case studies
of the European project {“}Future-oriented integrated management of
European forest landscapes{”} (INTEGRAL), gives an update on existing
decision support tools to run landscape simulation from Mediterranean to
boreal ecosystems. The main growth models and software available in
Europe are described, and the strengths and weaknesses of different
approaches are discussed. Trades-offs between input efforts and output
are illustrated. Recommendations for the selection of a forest landscape
simulator are given. The paper concludes by describing the need to have
tools that are able to cope with climate change and the need to build
more robust indicators for assessment of forest landscape sustainability
and vulnerability.</p>

<strong>Lessons from the first generation of marine ecological forecast
products</strong>. Frontiers in Marine Science. 4, <a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2017.00289" class="external-link uri">https://doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2017.00289</a>

<p>Recent years have seen a rapid expansion in the ability of earth
system models to describe and predict the physical state of the ocean.
Skilful forecasts ranging from seasonal (3 months) to decadal (5-10
years) time scales are now a reality. With the advance of these
forecasts of ocean physics, the first generation of marine ecological
forecasts has started to emerge. Such forecasts are potentially of great
value in the management of living marine resources and for all of those
who are dependent on the ocean for both nutrition and their livelihood;
however, this is still a field in its infancy. We review the state of
the art in this emerging field and identify the lessons that can be
learnt and carried forward from these pioneering efforts. The majority
of this first wave of products are forecasts of spatial distributions,
possibly reflecting the inherent suitability of this response variable
to the task of forecasting. Promising developments are also seen in
forecasting fish-stock recruitment where, despite well-recognized
challenges in understanding and predicting this response, new process
knowledge and model approaches that could form a basis for forecasting
are becoming available. Forecasts of phenology and coral-bleaching
events are also being applied to monitoring and industry decisions.
Moving marine ecological forecasting forward will require striking a
balance between what is feasible and what is useful. We propose here a
set of criteria to quickly identify {“}low-hanging fruit{”} that can
potentially be predicted; however, ensuring the usefulness of forecast
products also requires close collaboration with actively engaged
end-users. Realizing the full potential of marine ecological forecasting
will require bridging the gaps between marine ecology and climatology on
the one-hand, and between science and end-users on the other.
Nevertheless, the successes seen thus far and the potential to develop
further products suggest that the field of marine ecological forecasting
can be expected to flourish in the coming years.</p>

<p>Successfully predicting the future states of systems that are
complex, stochastic, and potentially chaotic is a major challenge. Model
forecasting error (FE) is the usual measure of success; however model
predictions provide no insights into the potential for improvement. In
short, the realized predictability of a specific model is uninformative
about whether the system is inherently predictable or whether the chosen
model is a poor match for the system and our observations thereof.
Ideally, model proficiency would be judged with respect to the systems’
intrinsic predictability, the highest achievable predictability given
the degree to which system dynamics are the result of deterministic
vs. stochastic processes. Intrinsic predictability may be quantified
with permutation entropy (PE), a model-free, information-theoretic
measure of the complexity of a time series. By means of simulations, we
show that a correlation exists between estimated PE and FE and show how
stochasticity, process error, and chaotic dynamics affect the
relationship. This relationship is verified for a data set of 461
empirical ecological time series. We show how deviations from the
expected PE–FE relationship are related to covariates of data quality
and the nonlinearity of ecological dynamics. These results demonstrate a
theoretically grounded basis for a model-free evaluation of a system’s
intrinsic predictability. Identifying the gap between the intrinsic and
realized predictability of time series will enable researchers to
understand whether forecasting proficiency is limited by the quality and
quantity of their data or the ability of the chosen forecasting model to
explain the data. Intrinsic predictability also provides a model-free
baseline of forecasting proficiency against which modeling efforts can
be evaluated.</p>

Climate Change Impacts on the Eastern Bering Sea Food Web Using a

</ul>
<p>Characterization of uncertainty (variance) in ecosystem projections
under climate change is still rare despite its importance for informing
decision-making and prioritizing research. We developed an ensemble
modeling framework to evaluate the relative importance of different
uncertainty sources for food web projections of the eastern Bering Sea
(EBS). Specifically, dynamically downscaled projections from Earth
System Models (ESM) under different greenhouse gas emission scenarios
(GHG) were used to force a multispecies size spectrum model (MSSM) of
the EBS food web. In addition to ESM and GHG uncertainty, we
incorporated uncertainty from different plausible fisheries management
scenarios reflecting shifts in the total allowable catch of flatfish and
gadids and different assumptions regarding temperature-dependencies on
biological rates in the MSSM. Relative to historical averages
(1994–2014), end-of-century (2080–2100 average) ensemble projections of
community spawner stock biomass, catches, and mean body size (±standard
deviation) decreased by 36% (±21%), 61% (±27%), and 38% (±25%),
respectively. Long-term trends were, on average, also negative for the
majority of species, but the level of trend consistency between ensemble
projections was low for most species. Projection uncertainty for model
outputs from ∼2020 to 2040 was driven by inter-annual climate
variability for 85% of species and the community as a whole. Thereafter,
structural uncertainty (different ESMs, temperature-dependency
assumptions) dominated projection uncertainty. Fishery management and
GHG emissions scenarios contributed little (&lt;10%) to projection
uncertainty, with the exception of catches for a subset of flatfishes
which were dominated by fishery management scenarios. Long-term outcomes
were improved in most cases under a moderate “mitigation” relative to a
high “business-as-usual” GHG emissions scenario and we show how
inclusion of temperature-dependencies on processes related to body
growth and intrinsic (non-predation) natural mortality can strongly
influence projections in potentially non-additive ways. Narrowing the
spread of long-term projections in future ensemble simulations will
depend primarily on whether the set of ESMs and food web models
considered behave more or less similarly to one another relative to the
present models sets. Further model skill assessment and data integration
are needed to aid in the reduction and quantification of uncertainties
if we are to advance predictive ecology.</p>

<p>Advances in ocean observing technologies and modeling provide the
capacity to revolutionize the management of living marine resources.
While traditional fisheries management approaches like single-species
stock assessments are still common, a global effort is underway to adopt
ecosystem-based fisheries management (EBFM) approaches. These approaches
consider changes in the physical environment and interactions between
ecosystem elements, including human uses, holistically. For example,
integrated ecosystem assessments aim to synthesize a suite of
observations (physical, biological, socioeconomic) and modeling
platforms [ocean circulation models, ecological models, short-term
forecasts, management strategy evaluations (MSEs)] to assess the current
status and recent and future trends of ecosystem components. This
information provides guidance for better management strategies. A common
thread in EBFM approaches is the need for high-quality observations of
ocean conditions, at scales that resolve critical physical-biological
processes and are timely for management needs. Here we explore options
for a future observing system that meets the needs of EBFM by (i)
identifying observing needs for different user groups, (ii) reviewing
relevant datasets and existing technologies, (iii) showcasing regional
case studies, and (iv) recommending observational approaches required to
implement EBFM. We recommend linking ocean observing within the context
of Global Ocean Observing System (GOOS) and other regional ocean
observing efforts with fisheries observations, new forecasting methods,
and capacity development, in a comprehensive ocean observing
framework.</p>

<p>Recurrent blooms of harmful algae and cyanobacteria (HABs) plague
many coastal and inland waters throughout the United States and have
significant socioeconomic impacts to the adjacent communities. Notable
HAB events in recent years continue to underscore the many remaining
gaps in knowledge and increased needs for technological advances leading
to early detection. This review summarizes the main research and
management priorities that can be addressed through ocean
observation-based approaches and technological solutions for harmful
algal blooms, provides an update to the state of the technology to
detect HAB events based on recent activities of the Alliance for Coastal
Technologies (ACT), offers considerations for ensuring data quality, and
highlights both ongoing challenges and opportunities for solutions in
integrating HAB-focused technologies in research and management.
Specifically, technological advances are discussed for remote sensing
(both multispectral satellite and hyperspectral); deployable in situ
detection of HAB species on fixed or mobile platforms (based on bulk or
taxa-specific biomass, images, or molecular approaches); and field-based
and/or rapid quantitative detection of HAB toxins (via molecular and
analytical chemistry methods). Suggestions for addressing challenges to
continued development and adoption of new technologies are summarized,
based on a consensus-building workshop hosted by ACT, including dealing
with the uncertainties in investment for HAB research, monitoring, and
management. Challenges associated with choosing appropriate technologies
for a given ecosystem and/or management concern are also addressed, and
examples of programs that are leveraging and combining complementary
approaches are highlighted.</p>

One of the significant challenges to using information and ideas
generated through ecosystem models and analyses for ecosystem-based
fisheries management is the disconnect between modeling and management
needs. Here we present a case study from the U.S. West Coast, the
stakeholder review of NOAA’s annual ecosystem status report for the
California Current Ecosystem established by the Pacific Fisheries
Management Council’s Fisheries Ecosystem Plan, showcasing a process to
identify management priorities that require information from ecosystem
models and analyses. We then assess potential ecosystem models and
analyses that could help address the identified policy concerns. We
screened stakeholder comments and found 17 comments highlighting the
need for ecosystem-level synthesis. Policy needs for ecosystem science
included: (1) assessment of how the environment affects productivity of
target species to improve forecasts of biomass and reference points
required for setting harvest limits, (2) assessment of shifts in the
spatial distribution of target stocks and protected species to
anticipate changes in availability and the potential for interactions
between target and protected species, (3) identification of trophic
interactions to better assess tradeoffs in the management of forage
species between the diet needs of dependent predators, the resilience of
fishing communities, and maintenance of the forage species themselves,
and (4) synthesis of how the environment affects efficiency and
profitability in fishing communities, either directly via extreme events
(e.g., storms) or indirectly via climate-driven changes in target
species availability. We conclude by exemplifying an existing management
process established on the U.S. West Coast that could be used to enable
the structured, iterative, and interactive communication between
managers, stakeholders, and modelers that is key to refining existing
ecosystem models and analyses for management use.

<p>Recent developments in global dynamical climate prediction systems
have allowed for skillful predictions of climate variables relevant to
living marine resources (LMRs) at a scale useful to understanding and
managing LMRs. Such predictions present opportunities for improved LMR
management and industry operations, as well as new research avenues in
fisheries science. LMRs respond to climate variability via changes in
physiology and behavior. For species and systems where climate-fisheries
links are well established, forecasted LMR responses can lead to
anticipatory and more effective decisions, benefitting both managers and
stakeholders. Here, we provide an overview of climate prediction systems
and advances in seasonal to decadal prediction of marine-resource
relevant environmental variables. We then describe a range of
climate-sensitive LMR decisions that can be taken at lead-times of
months to decades, before highlighting a range of pioneering case
studies using climate predictions to inform LMR decisions. The success
of these case studies suggests that many additional applications are
possible. Progress, however, is limited by observational and modeling
challenges. Priority developments include strengthening of the
mechanistic linkages between climate and marine resource responses,
development of LMR models able to explicitly represent such responses,
integration of climate driven LMR dynamics in the multi-driver context
within which marine resources exist, and improved prediction of
ecosystem-relevant variables at the fine regional scales at which most
marine resource decisions are made. While there are fundamental limits
to predictability, continued advances in these areas have considerable
potential to make LMR managers and industry decision more resilient to
climate variability and help sustain valuable resources. Concerted
dialog between scientists, LMR managers and industry is essential to
realizing this potential.</p>

<p>Populations of small pelagic fish are strongly influenced by climate.
The inability of managers to anticipate environment-driven fluctuations
in stock productivity or distribution can lead to overfishing and stock
collapses, inflexible management regulations inducing shifts in the
functional response to human predators, lost opportunities to harvest
populations, bankruptcies in the fishing industry, and loss of
resilience in the human food supply. Recent advances in dynamical global
climate prediction systems allow for sea surface temperature (SST)
anomaly predictions at a seasonal scale over many shelf ecosystems. Here
we assess the utility of SST predictions at this {“}fishery relevant{”}
scale to inform management, using Pacific sardine as a case study. The
value of SST anomaly predictions to management was quantified under four
harvest guidelines (HGs) differing in their level of integration of SST
data and predictions. The HG that incorporated stock biomass forecasts
informed by skillful SST predictions led to increases in stock biomass
and yield, and reductions in the probability of yield and biomass
falling below socioeconomic or ecologically acceptable levels. However,
to mitigate the risk of collapse in the event of an erroneous forecast,
it was important to combine such forecast-informed harvest controls with
additional harvest restrictions at low biomass.</p>

<p>Worldwide fisheries management has been undergoing a paradigm shift
from a single-species approach to ecosystem approaches. In the United
States, NOAA has adopted a policy statement and Road Map to guide the
development and implementation of ecosystem-based fisheries management
(EBFM). NOAA’s EBFM policy supports addressing the ecosystem
interconnections to help maintain resilient and productive ecosystems,
even as they respond to climate, habitat, ecological, and social and
economic changes. Managing natural marine resources while taking into
account their interactions with their environment and our human
interactions with our resources and environment requires the support of
ecosystem science, modeling, and analysis. Implementing EBFM will
require using existing mandates and approaches that fit regional
management structures and cultures. The primary mandate for managing
marine fisheries in the United States is the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery
Conservation and Management Act. Many tenets of the Act align well with
the EBFM policy, however, incorporating ecosystem analysis and models
into fisheries management processes has faced procedural challenges in
many jurisdictions. In this paper, we review example cases where
scientists have had success in using ecosystem analysis and modeling to
inform management priorities, and identify practices that help bring new
ecosystem science information into existing policy processes. A key to
these successes is regular communication and collaborative discourse
among modelers, stakeholders, and resource managers to tailor models and
ensure they addressed the management needs as directly as possible.</p>

</ul>
<p>Recruitment in age-structured stock assessment models can be
forecasted using a variety of algorithms to provide advice on the
anticipated consequences of different possible management actions.
Selecting one method over another usually involves some subjectivity,
yet can be consequential to the provision of advice. Extensive
case-specific testing is not always feasible. We evaluated the forecast
skill in 3-, 5- and 10-year forecasts of 16 recruitment forecasting
methods under various circumstances to provide a broad evaluation and
general guidelines on the reliability of forecasts. We used 31 operating
models based on existing stock assessment models applied to a diversity
of stocks with empirical data, which we show to be generally
representative of assessed stocks worldwide. Although no single
best-performing method could be identified, we found that time-series
methods were most likely to perform poorly. Both forecast skill across
all methods and forecast sensitivity to the selected method were linked
to the properties of the stock or assessment: age at maturity and
recruitment autocorrelation in 3-year forecasts and previous long-term
recruitment variability in 10-year forecasts. In some situations, all
forecasting methods resulted in systematic over- or underestimation of
spawning stock biomass. The simulation approach employed here to assess
forecast performance, rooted directly in the predictions of existing
stock assessment models, can be a complementary tool to existing
simulation approaches which generate alternative sets of population
dynamics or observations and we discussed the advantages and
limitations.</p>

<p>The influence of climate on marine populations is important for
predicting stock abundance of marine fishes, and has led to increasing
interest in environment-based forecasts (EBFs) for harvest management.
While some climate indices have proven useful for explaining
fluctuations in Pacific salmon stock abundance, there have also been
sudden failures of EBF models. I analyzed temporal patterns in
prediction skill for a variety of climate and ecosystem indicators as
predictors of marine survival for a coastal coho salmon stock by
computing prediction skill for 29 climate and ecosystem indices across
multiple time scales to explore patterns of skill across time. Results
demonstrate that predictive skill of EBF models is often ephemeral,
arising and falling suddenly across time. This behavior can be explained
both on a statistical basis and as a consequence of complex interactions
between climate, ecosystems, and populations involving both climate
regime shifts and ecosystem phase transitions. Forecast failures are
problematic for traditional forecast-dependent harvest management
approaches. Solutions for this problem may include improved forecast
models and improved climate and ecosystem indicators, but developing
management systems that are robust to forecast uncertainty would provide
a more reliable response to expected rapid ecosystem changes in response
to climate.</p>

</ul>
<p>Most forecasts for the future state of ecological systems are
conducted once and never updated or assessed. As a result, many
available ecological forecasts are not based on the most up-to-date
data, and the scientific progress of ecological forecasting models is
slowed by a lack of feedback on how well the forecasts perform.
Iterative near-term ecological forecasting involves repeated daily to
annual scale forecasts of an ecological system as new data becomes
available and regular assessment of the resulting forecasts. We
demonstrate how automated iterative near-term forecasting systems for
ecology can be constructed by building one to conduct monthly forecasts
of rodent abundances at the Portal Project, a long-term study with over
40 years of monthly data. This system automates most aspects of the six
stages of converting raw data into new forecasts: data collection, data
sharing, data manipulation, modelling and forecasting, archiving, and
presentation of the forecasts. The forecasting system uses R code for
working with data, fitting models, making forecasts, and archiving and
presenting these forecasts. The resulting pipeline is automated using
continuous integration (a software development tool) to run the entire
pipeline once a week. The cyberinfrastructure is designed for long-term
maintainability and to allow the easy addition of new models.
Constructing this forecasting system required a team with expertise
ranging from field site experience to software development. Automated
near-term iterative forecasting systems will allow the science of
ecological forecasting to advance more rapidly and provide the most
up-to-date forecasts possible for conservation and management. These
forecasting systems will also accelerate basic science by allowing new
models of natural systems to be quickly implemented and compared to
existing models. Using existing technology, and teams with diverse skill
sets, it is possible for ecologists to build automated forecasting
systems and use them to advance our understanding of natural
systems.</p>

<p>Recent observations of record low winter sea-ice coverage and warming
water temperatures in the eastern Bering Sea have signaled the potential
impacts of climate change on this ecosystem, which have implications for
commercial fisheries production. We investigate the impacts of
forecasted climate change on the eastern Bering Sea food web through the
end of the century under medium- and high-emissions climate scenarios in
combination with a selection of fisheries management strategies by
conducting simulations using a dynamic food web model. The outputs from
three global earth system models run under two greenhouse gas emission
scenarios were dynamically downscaled using a regional ocean and
biogeochemical model to project ecosystem dynamics at the base of the
food web. Four fishing scenarios were explored: status quo, no fishing,
and two scenarios that alternatively assume increased fishing emphasis
on either gadids or flatfishes. Annual fishery quotas were dynamically
simulated by combining harvest control rules based on model-simulated
stock biomass, while incorporating social and economic tradeoffs induced
by the Bering Sea’s combined groundfish harvest cap. There was little
predicted difference between the status quo and no fishing scenario for
most managed groundfish species biomasses at the end of the century,
regardless of emission scenario. Under the status quo fishing scenario,
biomass projections for most species and functional groups across
trophic levels showed a slow but steady decline toward the end of the
century, and most groups were near or below recent historical
(1991–2017) biomass levels by 2080. The bottom–up effects of declines in
biomass at lower trophic levels as forecasted by the climate-enhanced
lower trophic level modeling, drove the biomass trends at higher trophic
levels. By 2080, the biomass projections for species and trophic guilds
showed very little difference between emission scenarios. Our method for
climate-enhanced food web projections can support fisheries managers by
informing strategic guidance on the long-term impacts of ecosystem
productivity shifts driven by climate change on commercial species and
the food web, and how those impacts may interact with different
fisheries management scenarios.</p>

<p>Visually communicating temperature and precipitation climate outlook
graphics is challenging because it requires the viewer to be familiar
with probabilities as well as to have the visual literacy to interpret
geospatial forecast uncertainty. In addition, the visualization
scientific literature has open questions on which visual design choices
are the most effective at expressing the multidimensionality of
uncertain forecasts, leaving designers with a lack of concrete guidance.
Using a two-phase experimental setup, this study shows how recently
developed visualization diagnostic guidelines can be used to iteratively
diagnose, redesign, and test the understandability the U.S. National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Climate Prediction Center
(CPC) climate outlooks. In the first phase, visualization diagnostic
guidelines were used in conjunction with interviews and focus groups to
identify understandability challenges of existing visual conventions in
temperature and precipitation outlooks. Next, in a randomized control
versus experimental treatment setup, several graphic modifications were
produced and tested via an online survey of end users and the general
public. Results show that, overall, end users exhibit a better
understanding of outlooks, but some types of probabilistic color mapping
are misunderstood by both end users and the general public, which was
predicted by the diagnostic guidelines. Modifications lead to
significant gains in end-user and general public understanding of
climate outlooks, providing additional evidence for the utility of using
control versus treatment testing informed by visualization
diagnostics.</p>

<p>There have been multiple efforts in recent years to simplify visual
weather forecast products, with the goal of more efficient risk
communication for the general public. Many meteorological forecast
products, such as the cone of uncertainty, storm surge graphics, warning
polygons, and Storm Prediction Center (SPC) convective outlooks, have
created varying levels of public confusion resulting in revisions,
modifications, and improvements. However, the perception and
comprehension of private weather graphics produced by television
stations has been largely overlooked in peer-reviewed research. The goal
of this study is to explore how the extended forecast graphic, more
commonly known as the 7, 10 day, etc., is utilized by broadcasters and
understood by the public. Data were gathered from surveys with the
general public and also from broadcast meteorologists. Results suggest
this graphic is a source of confusion and highlights a disconnect
between the meteorologists producing the graphic and the content
prioritized by their audiences. Specifically, timing and intensity of
any precipitation or adverse weather events are the two most important
variables to consider from the viewpoint of the public. These variables
are generally absent from the extended forecast graphic, thus forcing
the public to draw their own conclusions, which may differ from what the
meteorologist intends to convey. Other results suggest the placement of
forecast high and low temperatures, use of probability of precipitation,
icon inconsistency, and length of time the graphic is shown also
contribute to public confusion and misunderstanding.</p>

<p>Weather forecasts are inherently uncertain, and meteorologists have
information about weather forecast uncertainty that is not readily
available to most forecast users. Yet effectively communicating forecast
uncertainty to nonmeteorologists remains challenging. Improving forecast
uncertainty communication requires research-based knowledge that can
inform decisions on what uncertainty information to communicate, when,
and how to do so. To help build such knowledge, this article explores
the public’s perspectives on everyday weather forecast uncertainty and
uncertainty information using results from a nationwide survey. By
contributing to the fundamental understanding of laypeople’s views on
forecast uncertainty, the findings can inform both uncertainty
communication and related research. The article uses empirical data from
a nationwide survey of the U.S. public to investigate beliefs commonly
held among meteorologists and to explore new topics. The results show
that when given a deterministic temperature forecast, most respondents
expected the temperature to fall within a range around the predicted
value. In other words, most people inferred uncertainty into the
deterministic forecast. People’s preferences for deterministic versus
nondeterministic forecasts were examined in two situations; in both, a
significant majority of respondents liked weather forecasts that
expressed uncertainty, and many preferred such forecasts to
single-valued forecasts. The article also discusses people’s confidence
in different types of forecasts, their interpretations of the
probability of precipitation forecasts, and their preferences for how
forecast uncertainty is conveyed. Further empirical research is needed
to study the article’s findings in other contexts and to continue
exploring perception, interpretation, communication, and use of weather
forecast uncertainty. © 2008 American Meteorological Society.</p>

<p>Evaluating impacts of observations on the skill of numerical weather
prediction (NWP) is important. The Ensemble Forecast Sensitivity to
Observation (EFSO) provides an efficient approach to diagnosing
observation impacts, quantifying how much each observation improves or
degrades a subsequent forecast with a given verification reference. This
study investigates the sensitivity of EFSO impact estimates to the
choice of the verification reference, using a global NWP system
consisting of the Non-hydrostatic Icosahedral Atmospheric Model (NICAM)
and the Local Ensemble Transform Kalman Filter (LETKF). The EFSO
evaluates observation impacts with the moist total energy norm and with
recently proposed observation-based verification metrics. The results
show that each type of observation mainly contributes to the improvement
of forecast departures of the observed variable maybe due to the
limitation of localization in the EFSO. The EFSO overestimates the
fraction of beneficial observations when verified with subsequent
analyses, especially for shorter lead times such as 6 h. We may avoid
this overestimation to some extent by verifying with observations,
analyses from other data assimilation (DA) systems, or analyses of an
independent run with the same DA system. In addition, this study
demonstrates two important issues possibly leading to overestimating
observation impacts. First, observation impacts would be overestimated
if we apply relaxation-to-prior methods to the initial conditions of the
ensemble forecasts in the EFSO; therefore, the ensemble forecasts in the
EFSO should be independent of the ensemble forecasts in the DA cycle.
Second, deterministic baseline forecasts of the EFSO, which represent
the forecast without DA, should be initialized by the ensemble mean of
the first guess at the analysis time, not by the previous analysis.</p>

<p>This paper develops and analyzes four energy scenarios for California
that are both exploratory and quantitative. The business-as-usual
scenario represents a pathway guided by outcomes and expectations
emerging from California’s energy crisis. Three alternative scenarios
represent contexts where clean energy plays a greater role in
California’s energy system: Split Public is driven by local and
individual activities; Golden State gives importance to integrated state
planning; Patriotic Energy represents a national drive to increase
energy independence. Future energy consumption, composition of
electricity generation, energy diversity, and greenhouse gas emissions
are analyzed for each scenario through 2035. Energy savings, renewable
energy, and transportation activities are identified as promising
opportunities for achieving alternative energy pathways in California. A
combined approach that brings together individual and community
activities with state and national policies leads to the largest energy
savings, increases in energy diversity, and reductions in greenhouse gas
emissions. Critical challenges in California’s energy pathway over the
next decades identified by the scenario analysis include dominance of
the transportation sector, dependence on fossil fuels, emissions of
greenhouse gases, accounting for electricity imports, and diversity of
the electricity sector. The paper concludes with a set of policy lessons
revealed from the California energy scenarios. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All

<p>Forecasting for wind and solar renewable energy is becoming more
important as the amount of energy generated from these sources
increases. Forecast skill is improving, but so too is the way forecasts
are being used. In this paper, we present a brief overview of the
state-of-the-art of forecasting wind and solar energy. We describe
approaches in statistical and physical modeling for time scales from
minutes to days ahead, for both deterministic and probabilistic
forecasting. Our focus changes then to consider the future of
forecasting for renewable energy. We discuss recent advances which show
potential for great improvement in forecast skill. Beyond the forecast
itself, we consider new products which will be required to aid decision
making subject to risk constraints. Future forecast products will need
to include probabilistic information, but deliver it in a way tailored
to the end user and their specific decision making problems. Businesses
operating in this sector may see a change in business models as more
people compete in this space, with different combinations of skills,
data and modeling being required for different products. The transaction
of data itself may change with the adoption of blockchain technology,
which could allow providers and end users to interact in a trusted, yet
decentralized way. Finally, we discuss new industry requirements and
challenges for scenarios with high amounts of renewable energy. New
forecasting products have the potential to model the impact of
renewables on the power system, and aid dispatch tools in guaranteeing
system security. This article is categorized under: Energy

<p>Integrated, interdisciplinary crop performance forecasting systems,
linked with appropriate decision and discussion support tools, could
substantially improve operational decision making in agricultural
management. Recent developments in connecting numerical weather
prediction models and general circulation models with quantitative crop
growth models offer the potential for development of integrated systems
that incorporate components of long-term climate change. However,
operational seasonal forecasting systems have little or no value unless
they are able to change key management decisions. Changed decision
making through incorporation of seasonal forecasting ultimately has to
demonstrate improved long-term performance of the cropping enterprise.
Simulation analyses conducted on specific production scenarios are
especially useful in improving decisions, particularly if this is done
in conjunction with development of decision-support systems and
associated facilitated discussion groups. Improved management of the
overall crop production system requires an interdisciplinary approach,
where climate scientists, agricultural scientists and extension
specialists are intimately linked with crop production managers in the
development of targeted seasonal forecast systems. The same principle
applies in developing improved operational management systems for
commodity trading organizations, milling companies and agricultural
marketing organizations. Application of seasonal forecast systems across
the whole value chain in agricultural production offers considerable
benefits in improving overall operational management of agricultural
production. © 2005 The Royal Society.</p>

<p>The FAIRWAY project reviewed approaches for protecting drinking water
from nitrate and pesticide pollution. A comprehensive assessment of
decision support tools (DSTs) used by farmers, advisors, water managers
and policy makers across the European Union as an aid to meeting CAP
objectives and targets was undertaken, encompassing paper-based
guidelines, farm-level and catchment level software, and complex
research models. More than 150 DSTs were identified, with 36 ranked for
further investigation based on how widely they were used and/or their
potential relevance to the FAIRWAY case studies. Of those, most were
farm management tools promoting smart nutrient/pesticide use, with only
three explicitly considering the impact of mitigation methods on water
quality. Following demonstration and evaluation, 12 DSTs were selected
for practical testing at nine diverse case study sites, based on their
pertinence to local challenges and scales of interest. Barriers to DST
exchange between member states were identified and information was
collected about user requirements and attitudes. Key obstacles to
exchange include differences in legislation, advisory frameworks,
country-specific data and calibration requirements, geo-climate and
issues around language. Notably, DSTs from different countries using the
same input data sometimes delivered very different results. Whilst many
countries have developed DSTs to address similar problems, all case
study participants were able to draw inspiration from elsewhere. The
support and advice provided by skilled advisors was highly valued,
empowering end users to most effectively use DST outputs.</p>

<p>The interdisciplinary nature of sports and the presence of various
systemic and non-systemic factors introduce challenges in predicting
sports match outcomes using a single disciplinary approach. In contrast
to previous studies that use sports performance metrics and statistical
models, this study is the first to apply a deep learning approach in
financial time series modeling to predict sports match outcomes. The
proposed approach has two main components: a convolutional neural
network (CNN) classifier for implicit pattern recognition and a logistic
regression model for match outcome judgment. First, the raw data used in
the prediction are derived from the betting market odds and actual
scores of each game, which are transformed into sports candlesticks.
Second, CNN is used to classify the candlesticks time series on a
graphical basis. To this end, the original 1D time series are encoded
into 2D matrix images using Gramian angular field and are then fed into
the CNN classifier. In this way, the winning probability of each matchup
team can be derived based on historically implied behavioral patterns.
Third, to further consider the differences between strong and weak
teams, the CNN classifier adjusts the probability of winning the match
by using the logistic regression model and then makes a final judgment
regarding the match outcome. We empirically test this approach using
18,944 National Football League game data spanning 32 years and find
that using the individual historical data of each team in the CNN
classifier for pattern recognition is better than using the data of all
teams. The CNN in conjunction with the logistic regression judgment
model outperforms the CNN in conjunction with SVM, Naïve Bayes,
Adaboost, J48, and random forest, and its accuracy surpasses that of
betting market prediction.</p>

<p>A large amount of effort is spent on forecasting the outcomes of
sporting events, but few papers have focused exclusively on the
characteristics of sports forecasts. Instead, many papers have been
written about the efficiency of sports betting markets. As it turns out,
it is possible to derive a considerable amount of information about the
forecasts and the forecasting process from studies that have tested the
markets for economic efficiency. Moreover, the huge number of
observations provided by betting markets makes it possible to obtain
robust tests of various forecasting hypotheses. This paper is concerned
with a number of forecasting topics in horse racing and several team
sports. The first topic involves the type of forecast that is made:
picking a winner or predicting whether a particular team will beat the
point spread. Different evaluation procedures will be examined and
alternative forecasting methods (models, experts, and the market)
compared. The paper also examines the evidence with regard to the
existence of biases in the forecasts, and concludes by discussing the
applicability of these results to forecasting in general. © 2010

<p>Forecasting has emerged as an important component of informed,
data-driven decision-making in a wide array of fields. We introduce a
new data model for probabilistic predictions that encompasses a wide
range of forecasting settings. This framework clearly defines the
constituent parts of a probabilistic forecast and proposes one approach
for representing these data elements. The data model is implemented in
Zoltar, a new software application that stores forecasts using the data
model and provides standardized API access to the data. In one real-time
case study, an instance of the Zoltar web application was used to store,
provide access to, and evaluate real-time forecast data on the order of
108 rows, provided by over 40 international research teams from academia
and industry making forecasts of the COVID-19 outbreak in the US. Tools
and data infrastructure for probabilistic forecasts, such as those
introduced here, will play an increasingly important role in ensuring
that future forecasting research adheres to a strict set of rigorous and
reproducible standards.</p>

<p>Forecasting is a common data science task that helps organizations
with capacity planning, goal setting, and anomaly detection. Despite its
importance, there are serious challenges associated with producing
reliable and high-quality forecasts—especially when there are a variety
of time series and analysts with expertise in time series modeling are
relatively rare. To address these challenges, we describe a practical
approach to forecasting “at scale” that combines configurable models
with analyst-in-the-loop performance analysis. We propose a modular
regression model with interpretable parameters that can be intuitively
adjusted by analysts with domain knowledge about the time series. We
describe performance analyses to compare and evaluate forecasting
procedures, and automatically flag forecasts for manual review and
adjustment. Tools that help analysts to use their expertise most
effectively enable reliable, practical forecasting of business time
series.</p>
