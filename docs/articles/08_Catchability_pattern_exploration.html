</h2>
<p>We can plot effort from both constant catchability (the OM) and
density-dependent catchability below:</p>
<p>The scale is different but the trends still appear similar - I think
this is because effort is still mostly following the trend from fishing
mortality. There are a few reasons this may make sense, or not. I don’t
think there should be a relationship between fishing mortality and
biomass, at least in the same period, since fishing mortality is
exogenous (by definition?).</p>
<p>There might be a relationship between lagged mortality and biomass,
if for example fishing more in this period affects biomass in the next
period. However, this relationship seems to be positive (am I misreading
this?), which also seems to imply more fishing results in more future
fish. I would be worried any relationship here is spurious.</p>
<p>An alternative is to look at catch per unit effort, and control for
fishing mortality. This could follow if we were examining a fishery
where catches are exogenously set by management, and harvesters always
fulfill the total allowable catch, as a simplifying starting
assumption.</p>
<p>The first plot below is then catch per unit effort, with total
catches per year taken from the EwE operating model. Notably, catches
are not 1:1 with fishing mortality, but rather they already move with
biomass, which is surprising (there’s already some kind of catchability
set in the OM?).</p>
<p>The second plot assumes we can observe true fishing mortality, and is
fishing mortality per unit effort. By definition, we can then recover
catchability.</p>
<p>Then we plot the relationship between each indicator (lagged) and
biomass, where the first is fishing mortality per unit effort and the
second catch per unit effort.</p>
<p>Notably, for the catch per unit effort, the relationship with biomass
is positive. Catches tend to increase with biomass, and catches largely
dominate the trend (compared to catchability). Then, when catches are
low, biomass is relatively smaller, and future biomass is also smaller
on average. I would guess that specifying catchability likely doesn’t
affect the indicator in the this plot, which is largely driven by
catches (which is a function of biomass?).</p>
<p>For fishing mortality, the relationship with biomass is negative.
This is due to the functional form we have specified for catchability,
which decreases as biomass increases. Because biomass tends to move
positively with lagged biomass, when when catchability is good, biomass
is (relatively) low, and we can expect future biomass to also be smaller
on average.</p>
<p>Below, we plot lagged indicators on biomass estimates from JABBA, as
well as the status of indicators over years and FMSY benchmarks.</p>
<p>I think, for me, the benefit of using fishing mortality is that
there’s a well- defined mechanism that I can see drive the results:
catchability is a function of biomass, so it should tell us something
about future biomass as long as we can recover it.</p>
<p>I think catch per unit effort would work as well here, but I don’t
see a need to use catchability anymore, or at least it appears there’s
already some sort of catchability implicit in EwE? As far as I can see
it’s all -9999 as inputs into EwE so I’m not quite sure what’s going on
here yet. But to the extent catches increase with biomass, there’s a
relationship there to exploit. The story would then be if fishers catch
more for the same mortality when biomass is larger, because it’s easier
to catch fish conditional on the same time spent, fuel consumed,
etc.</p>
<p>I think with previous indicators like price, it could work but I’m
not following the mechanism where prices have some relationship with
biomass in the EwE OM. Although I’m sure I miss a lot of things so I
apologize in advance!</p>
