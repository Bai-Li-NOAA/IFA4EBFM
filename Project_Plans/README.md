**Comments**

    - Forecast accuracy of current models
      - What typical error rates are (for real, not simulated, data) and how much this varies by method, data type, etc. 
      - Performance benchmarks for different time scales and forecasting tools
    - Management
      - How to develop more formal model-predictive control approaches to optimizing management using forecasts?
